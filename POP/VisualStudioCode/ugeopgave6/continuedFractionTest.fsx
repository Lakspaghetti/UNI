/// The function "round" is used to ensure that fsharp only checks for 3 decimals. This is necessary due to the way floats are expressed in fsharp. I.e. if the function round is not used, then it wouldn't return the bool "true" because there would be too many "hidden" decimals that wouldn't match up.
/// The function is set to round to 3 decimals, because it's relativly close enough to the actual value and because it will round the third decimal to what it is supposed to be I.e. The number 4.0 is actually written as 3.99999... Meaning that if you were to calculate a float, there would be missing decimals that would end up in an "incorrect" or inprecise result, but rounding the number will get the desired or "precise" result
